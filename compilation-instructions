For anyone trying to compile and run the program:

Using CLion:
1) Create server CMake config in top right menu
2) Set working dir to project root
3) Create client CMake config
4) Set working dir to project root
5) Create compound config
6) Add server and client configs to compound config
From there, you can run as usual, and both tabs should open normally.
